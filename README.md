# Modern-SADX-BETA
Modern SADX mod in BETA! Hope you enjoy! A texture/sfx mod. Basically.

This mod is based of SADX 06 v.7 by SirGiygas, just a lot cooler*
I've refined his textures so the characters don't look weird in some areas (like Amy's ears. They were brighter than her arms which shouldn't even be a thing).

Some small shadow detail on Sonic's shoes have been added. Non-Light-Speed shoes have been recoloured to the same as his upgraded ones due to animation (basically, consistency).

A LOT of SFX changing, like in-game voice clips and stage music, have been (mostly) replaced with Modern Sonic songs that suite the level. Sounds from '06, Unleashed, Generations, Lost World, Boom (yes, Boom voice clips) and even Sonic Forces have been used. TONS OF CHANGES!

Events- Sadness and Strain (for Chaos) have been replaced with new audio. Sadness- Sonic Forces: Light of Hope (instrumnetal) and Strain- Sonic Lost World: Opening scene. Honestly, I don't even know how, but both actually fit the game pretty well (like with cutscence timings)
Speaking of timings, Eggman's theme is now the modern version, but from the best game ever. Sonic '06. You'll notice this when you start a new file and play through SADX again. 
Modern Sonic's wit is now added in, so none of that plain "READY! GO!" stuff. New and better.

NOTE- not all Sonic fans will like this due to a contrating division in "who's the best voice actor?"
HAte me all you want, but I added Roger's voice for this one. Jason Griffith's voice clips were too boring (tRiGgErEd)

Anyways, with all that done, tell me what you think of this. Do you like this? Perhaps there's a few tweaks (obviously, since I'm not done). I'm open to suggestions, no matter how crticial they are, I'll try my best to deliver (probably) the best texture/sound mod for SADX.
Thanks SirGiygas for the foundation of my mod! 

Make sure to load this above ALL mods. I recommend (if you have these) putting SADX:FE as the first mod to load. Then the Lantern Engine second. THEN Modern SADX 3rd. 

Oh, and if you have HD GUI 2, load that after all of your mods (especially the Goal Ring mod. Those two don't seem to like each other)

Thanks for downloading this! Hope you like it!

Final note- if you're using the latest version of HD GUI 2, you'll only notice lebel and charcter textures. Stuff like the HUD and OBJECT_REGULAR will not load, as HD GUI 2 just doesn't work like it used to. Basically, before the Jamuary update (25th I think), if you put the folder OBJECT_REGULAR from my mod into HD GUI 2, it actually worked. Now, it doesn't work, and without the HD GUI's version of OBJECT_REGULAR, it will never work. So, use the one I placed instead. It workes the same, just a little off. For example, the options menu isn't what it's meant to be. Some system font textures don't load up properly. One last thing. This glitch has been around for a few months now, and I can't solve it. The spring and checkpoint texture are actually messed up (you can see for yourself). I don't know how or why this happened, but I've tried everything, and nothing works. Sorry about that.

Make sure to back up your original HD GUI 2 mod when replacing it with mine.
